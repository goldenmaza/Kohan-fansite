						The Shadow race
					</h1>
					<p>
						The Shadow race contain creatures that are very befouled, they want nothing for themselves and they only serve one
						master: Ahriman. Their numbers are what makes them dangerous, and of course their morale.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						Their biggest weakness are from Khaldunite attacks. With a 20% extra damage, per strike, it makes
						them weak against an army of anything that uses that kind of weaponry or magic.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						One strong suite that this race has are their well guarded forts that houses a horde of Reavers,
						these as well as the Gauri forts, are two of the strongest in the game.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						On the next page you can find a list of all units that are being used by the Shadow race.
